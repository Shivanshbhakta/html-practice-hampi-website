1. <b><u>The Stone Chariot-</u></b>
The chariot is actually a shrine dedicated to Garuda, built inside the Vittala Temple Complex.  The massive sculpture of Garuda, Lord Vishnu’s escort once was seated atop the chariot but it is empty at the present date. The Hampi Chariot has earned its name among the other three famous stone chariots in India- One in Konark, Odissa, and the other in Mahabalipuram
