    The stone chariot of the Vittala Temple and the templeâ€™s musical pillars may be the most recognizable architectural structure in Hampi but they are far from being the only ones. On the banks of the River Tungabhadra, Hampi is home to a number of Jain and Hindu temples, aqueducts and the Royal Enclosure spread over 59000 square meters. This was once upon a time, the home of the Vijayanagara King and his Queens. Today the enclosure lies largely in ruins but still speaks loudly of the life it once contained.
